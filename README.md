# GenAi: Advanced Generative AI Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains an advanced Google Colab notebook titled **GenAi.ipynb**, designed for teaching and demonstrating sophisticated generative AI concepts and applications. The notebook is structured to provide a deep dive into data preparation, model architecture, training pipelines, and evaluation techniques specifically tailored for generative AI models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and LLMs (Large Language Models).

## Notebook Contents

### 1. **Data Pipeline and Preprocessing**
   - Implementing efficient data loading techniques using `tf.data` for TensorFlow and `DataLoader` for PyTorch to optimize training performance.
   - Advanced data augmentation strategies including image transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation, flipping) and tokenization techniques (using `Hugging Face Transformers` and `spaCy`) for text-based models.
   - Utilizing data caching and prefetching to ensure high throughput during training.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization of high-dimensional data using PCA and t-SNE for both image and text datasets to uncover latent structures.
   - Statistical analysis using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to explore feature distributions and identify potential biases in the dataset.
   - Correlation analysis and feature importance ranking to understand relationships between variables.

### 3. **Model Development and Training**
   - **GAN Architecture**: Detailed implementation of a GAN architecture, including:
     - Discriminator and Generator models using `Keras` and `PyTorch`.
     - Techniques like spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss for improving model stability and performance.
   - **LLM Training**: Fine-tuning pre-trained transformers using `Hugging Face Transformers` and `LangChain` with support for multi-GPU distributed training using `torch.distributed`.
   - Model training pipeline leveraging:
     - Optimizers such as AdamW with learning rate schedules (e.g., cosine decay).
     - Mixed precision training (`AMP`) for reduced memory footprint and faster computation.

### 4. **Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Quantitative metrics like MAE, RMSE, and FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) for generative models.
     - Qualitative evaluation using human-in-the-loop methods for text generation coherence and image fidelity.
   - Techniques for hyperparameter optimization using libraries like `Optuna` for efficient tuning of learning rates, batch sizes, and architectures.
   - Model calibration and validation using ensemble techniques to improve model robustness.

### 5. **Deployment and Integration**
   - Integration with `FastAPI` for real-time inference, including efficient batching and asynchronous processing to minimize latency.
   - Model serialization and deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) using containers and serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda) for scalability.
   - Monitoring and logging using `Langfuse` and `Prometheus` to track performance metrics, model drift, and request latencies.
